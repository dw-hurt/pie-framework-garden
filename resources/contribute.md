## How to Contribute to the PIE Framework

The PIE Framework is a living project. It evolves through critique, implementation, failure, and learning. **Your participation makes it better.**

---

## **Why Contribute?**

### **1. PIE Is Incomplete**
No ethical framework can anticipate every challenge. Your experience reveals gaps we haven't seen.

### **2. PIE Has Blind Spots**
The framework emerged from Western philosophical traditions and Elena Torres's positionality. Your cultural perspective may reveal limitations or opportunities for extension.

### **3. PIE Needs Testing**
Implementation reveals what works and what doesn't. Your case studies help refine the framework.

### **4. PIE Serves a Community**
AI ethics is not a solo project. We need researchers, practitioners, policymakers, users, and critics working together.

---

## **Ways to Contribute**

### **1. Critique the Framework**

**What we need:**
- Point out logical inconsistencies
- Identify cultural limitations or biases
- Show where principles conflict in practice
- Demonstrate cases where PIE fails

**How to submit:**
- Write a response paper (cite specific sections of PIE)
- Open a GitHub issue: [pie-framework-garden/issues](https://github.com/dw-hurt/pie-framework-garden/issues)
- Email: etorres@stanford.edu
- Engage on social media: #PIEFramework

**What happens:**
- Substantive critiques are integrated into [Academic Exchanges](../intellectual-foundations/academic-exchanges.md)
- Framework is revised based on valid criticisms
- Contributors are acknowledged

**Example:** Dr. Amara Okafor's critique of cultural imperialism (2031) led to the transcultural revision of PIE (2032) incorporating Ubuntu philosophy.

---

### **2. Share Implementation Experiences**

**What we need:**
- Case studies of PIE in practice
- What worked and what didn't
- Practical challenges you encountered
- Solutions you developed

**How to submit:**
- Write a blog post or paper
- Submit case study: [pie-framework-garden/case-studies](https://github.com/dw-hurt/pie-framework-garden/tree/main/case-studies)
- Present at conferences
- Share on community forums

**What happens:**
- Case studies are featured in [Practical Implementation Guide](../the-manifesto/practical-implementation.md)
- Lessons learned inform framework updates
- Community learns from your experience

**We especially need:**
- PIE failures (what went wrong?)
- Non-Western implementations
- Applications in unexpected domains
- Longitudinal studies (outcomes over months/years)

---

### **3. Develop Technical Tools**

**What we need:**
- PIE assessment templates
- Automated bias auditing tools
- Explainability frameworks
- Metrics for measuring flourishing
- Open-source PIE-aligned systems

**How to submit:**
- Contribute code: [pie-framework-garden/tools](https://github.com/dw-hurt/pie-framework-garden/tree/main/tools)
- Share on GitHub with #PIEFramework tag
- Write technical blog posts

**What happens:**
- Tools are shared with community
- Documentation is added to [Resources](../resources/)
- You're credited as contributor

---

### **4. Translate PIE Culturally**

**What we need:**
- How does PIE translate into non-Western ethical traditions?
- Ubuntu (African philosophy)
- Confucian ethics (East Asian)
- Islamic moral philosophy
- Indigenous frameworks
- Buddhist ethics
- Hindu dharma

**How to submit:**
- Write comparative analysis
- Collaborate with Elena or other PIE researchers
- Publish independently and share

**What happens:**
- Transcultural perspectives are integrated
- Framework becomes more inclusive
- We learn what's universal vs. culturally specific

**Example:** Dr. Okafor's work on relational autonomy (Ubuntu) led to revised understanding of "Respect Autonomy" that doesn't assume Western individualism.

---

### **5. Conduct Empirical Research**

**What we need:**
- Longitudinal studies: Do PIE-aligned systems promote flourishing?
- Comparative studies: PIE vs. other frameworks
- User studies: How do people experience PIE-aligned systems?
- Organizational studies: What enables/blocks PIE adoption?

**How to submit:**
- Publish in academic journals
- Share preprints (arXiv, SSRN)
- Present at conferences
- Email Elena with findings

**What happens:**
- Research cited in [Bibliography](bibliography.md)
- Findings inform framework revisions
- Community gains evidence base

---

### **6. Advocate for PIE**

**What we need:**
- Blog posts explaining PIE to general audiences
- Educational materials (videos, infographics, workshops)
- Policy advocacy (translate PIE into regulations)
- Organizational adoption (bring PIE to your company)

**How to help:**
- Write about PIE in accessible language
- Create teaching materials
- Organize workshops or reading groups
- Reference PIE in policy discussions
- Champion PIE within your organization

**What happens:**
- Materials shared in community resources
- PIE reaches broader audiences
- Framework gains adoption and impact

---

### **7. Fund PIE Research**

**What we need:**
- Research grants for PIE implementation studies
- Fellowships for cross-cultural PIE research
- Funding for PIE educational materials
- Support for PIE working groups

**How to help:**
- If you're a funder: Contact etorres@stanford.edu
- If you're a researcher: Apply for grants citing PIE
- If you're an organization: Sponsor PIE research or events
