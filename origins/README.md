# Origins: How PIE Was Born

The PIE Framework did not emerge from abstract theorizing. It was forged in failure, refined through critique, and offered with humility.

## The Story

In 2027, Dr. Elena MarÃ­a Torres created a comprehensive system with 287 rules for ethical AI. It was brilliant. It was validated. It prevented hundreds of suicides.

It also destroyed the life of a young person named Alex.

This is the story of how that failure led to a fundamental rethinking of AI ethicsâ€”from comprehensive rules to guiding principles.
