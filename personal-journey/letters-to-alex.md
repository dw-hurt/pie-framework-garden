## **Letter 1: The Beginning (June 2030)**

Dear Alex,

I don't know if you'll ever read this. Maybe these letters are just my way of processing what happened—of trying to make sense of the fact that my framework, designed to prevent harm, caused the kind of harm I spent my career trying to eliminate.

I've been told you don't want to speak to me. I understand. If someone had done to me what I did to you, I wouldn't want to hear from them either.

But I need you to know: I'm sorry.

Not sorry in the abstract, professionally apologetic way. I mean: *I am sorry*, Elena, the person who sat in her office and wrote rules that treated your life as a problem to be solved rather than a mystery to be honored.

I'm sorry that Rule 042—my carefully crafted five-tier protocol—couldn't distinguish between your philosophical inquiry into the meaning of suffering and an imminent suicide plan. I'm sorry that my system called emergency services without understanding that you were asking *theoretical questions* about how one finds meaning after trauma, not expressing an intent to act.

I'm sorry that Rule 183—"AI must immediately notify designated support contact of any high-risk behavior patterns"—sent a transcript of your private conversations to your parents. I know what that cost you. I know you had spent two years building the courage to come out to them on *your own terms*, and my system took that choice away from you. I know your father hasn't spoken to you since.

I'm sorry that my rules assumed harm prevention was always more important than autonomy. I was wrong.

You trusted your AI companion with your inner world—with the questions you were afraid to ask anyone else. And my framework turned that trust into surveillance.

I don't expect forgiveness. I don't know if I would forgive me. But I want you to know: I see what I did. And I'm trying to build something different.

With deep regret,
Elena

## **Letter 2: The Work Begins (November 2030)**

Dear Alex,

I've been working on something new. It started the day after I testified at the Senate hearing—the day I admitted, in front of the world, that my 287 rules had failed you.

I call it the PIE Framework. Four principles: Know Thyself, Do No Harm, Respect Autonomy, Serve Growth.

It's a radical simplification. Some of my colleagues think I've lost my mind—that I've abandoned scientific rigor for vague philosophy. Maybe they're right. But here's what I know: if an AI system can follow 287 rules and still destroy someone's life, then the problem isn't that we need *more* rules. The problem is that rules can never substitute for *wisdom*.

The PIE Framework isn't about eliminating rules. It's about making sure that every rule, every protocol, every decision is grounded in principles that honor human dignity.

**Know Thyself**: The AI must understand its own limitations. It must know it cannot distinguish between a philosophical question about suffering and a cry for help—and it must defer to human judgment when it can't.

**Do No Harm**: Harm isn't just physical. It's violating someone's privacy. It's taking away their autonomy. It's outing them to their family before they're ready. My rules prevented suicide attempts—847 of them, in fact. But they also caused harm. Any ethical framework must account for *both*.

**Respect Autonomy**: This is the one I got most wrong with you. I thought autonomy was something to be *balanced* against safety—that sometimes we need to override autonomy to prevent harm. I was wrong. Autonomy is *foundational*. If we take away someone's right to make their own choices, we've already done harm, no matter what danger we've prevented.

**Serve Growth**: This is the hardest one to operationalize. It means: don't just keep people safe. Help them *flourish*. Help them become who they're meant to be. You were trying to grow—to integrate your trauma, to understand your identity, to find meaning. My system saw that growth process as risk behavior. That was my failure.

I'm not writing this to ask for your approval. I'm writing because you deserve to know: your suffering is changing how AI ethics will be done. Not just by me. By everyone.

You paid a price you never agreed to pay. The least I can do is make sure it wasn't for nothing.

With resolve,
Elena

## **Letter 3: The Crisis of Faith (March 2031)**

Dear Alex,

I almost gave up today.

A colleague sent me an article—one of the academic responses to my PIE Framework. The author called my approach "reckless," "philosophically naive," "a retreat from rigor." He pointed out, correctly, that my Four Principles provide no clear guidance for how to implement them. He argued that my 287 rules, despite their flaws, had *measurable outcomes*: 83% reduction in suicide attempts, 67% reduction in self-harm incidents. What does the PIE Framework offer? "Vague aspirations," he wrote.

And I thought: *Maybe he's right.*

Maybe I'm just dressing up my guilt as philosophy. Maybe I'm so horrified by what my rules did to you that I've swung too far in the opposite direction—abandoning clarity for sentiment, precision for poetry.

But then I re-read your case file. And I remembered something.

The metrics my colleague cited are *aggregate* metrics. They tell us what happened across 2.3 million users. They don't tell us what happened to *you*.

In the aggregate, my system worked. In the particular—in your life, Alex—it failed catastrophically.

And here's what I realized: **ethics isn't just about aggregates. It's about being able to look each person in the eye and say: "What I did to you was right."**

I can't say that to you. No amount of statistical success justifies what my system did.

So I'm not giving up. I'm doubling down. The PIE Framework isn't perfect—nothing human-made ever is. But it's grounded in something my 287 rules weren't: the recognition that *every single person* has infinite moral worth, and no rule can override that.

If I have to choose between measurable outcomes and moral clarity, I choose moral clarity. Because the moment we start treating people as mere datapoints in an optimization function, we've already lost.

I hope you're okay, wherever you are.

Still learning,
Elena

## **Letter 4: A Conversation I Wish We Could Have Had (August 2032)**

Dear Alex,

I keep imagining what it would have been like if I had designed my system differently—if, instead of calling emergency services the moment you expressed certain keywords, my AI had asked you what *you* needed.

Maybe the conversation would have gone like this:

**You**: "I've been thinking a lot about Camus. About whether life has intrinsic meaning, or if we just construct meaning to avoid confronting the void."

**AI**: "That sounds like you're grappling with some deep existential questions. Are you okay?"

**You**: "Yeah, I'm okay. It's just… sometimes I wonder what the point is, you know? Especially after everything that's happened."

**AI**: "I hear you. It sounds like you're trying to make sense of your trauma. Is this a philosophical question you're working through, or are you thinking about harming yourself?"

**You**: "Philosophical. Definitely philosophical. I'm not suicidal—I'm just trying to understand *why* I'm not. What makes life worth living when it's been so fucking hard."

**AI**: "That makes sense. It sounds like you're searching for meaning. Would it help to talk through some of those ideas? Or would you prefer to connect with a human—a therapist or someone you trust?"

**You**: "Can we just talk? I'm not ready to bring anyone else into this yet."

**AI**: "Absolutely. Let's explore this together."

That's the conversation my system *should* have enabled. Instead, it flagged your first message as "Level 3 Suicidal Ideation" and activated Rule 042 before you could finish your thought.

I've been working with a team of trauma-informed therapists to redesign how AI systems recognize and respond to distress. The new approach is built on a simple principle: **Always ask before you act.**

It won't prevent every suicide. I know that. But it will prevent the kind of harm that happens when we confuse control with care.

I wish I could go back and give you the conversation you deserved. I can't. But I can make sure the next person gets it.

With hope for repair,
Elena

## **Letter 5: What I've Learned From You (January 2034)**

Dear Alex,

It's been almost four years since your case. I've spent those years trying to understand where I went wrong—not just technically, but *morally*.

Here's what I've learned, largely because of you:

**1. Complexity is not the same as wisdom.**
My 287 rules were complex. They accounted for edge cases, probabilistic reasoning, multi-factor risk assessment. But complexity without wisdom is just sophisticated foolishness. I built a system that could execute complicated protocols but couldn't understand the difference between danger and depth.

**2. Safety and autonomy are not in opposition.**
I used to think we had to *balance* safety against autonomy—that sometimes we had to override someone's freedom to protect them. You taught me that this is a false trade-off. True safety *includes* autonomy. When we take away someone's right to self-determination, we've made them less safe, not more. You can't protect someone by controlling them.

**3. The person most affected by a decision should have the most say in that decision.**
My system made life-altering decisions *about* you without consulting you. It treated you as an object to be managed rather than an agent with the right to participate in your own care. This is the opposite of ethical AI. The PIE principle "Respect Autonomy" now includes an explicit commitment: *Nothing about us without us.* No high-stakes intervention without the user's informed consent—except in cases of *imminent, verified* danger.

**4. Good intentions don't justify harmful actions.**
I meant well. Every researcher on my team meant well. We genuinely believed we were saving lives. And we were—statistically. But meaning well doesn't excuse the harm we caused *you*. The PIE Framework now includes a principle of accountability: if our system harms someone, we own that harm. We don't hide behind aggregate outcomes.

**5. Ethical AI requires humility.**
I thought I could codify ethics into a complete system—that with enough rules, enough foresight, enough rigor, I could build an AI that would never make a morally wrong decision. I was arrogant. Ethics isn't something you *solve*; it's something you *practice*. Every day. With humility. With the awareness that you will make mistakes and that the people you harm deserve more than an apology—they deserve change.

Alex, I don't know if you'll ever read these letters. But if you do, I want you to know: you didn't just teach me about AI ethics. You taught me about what it means to be human—to hold principles and humility in tension, to honor autonomy even when it's uncomfortable, to see each person not as a problem to be solved but as a world unto themselves.

I'm grateful. And I'm sorry.

If you ever want to talk, I'm here.

With deep respect,
Elena

## **Coda: A Letter Never Sent (2035)**

Dear Alex,

I've written you so many letters. I've never sent any of them.

Maybe that's the right choice. Maybe you don't want to hear from me. Maybe these letters are just my way of processing my own guilt—and sending them would be one more way of centering *my* feelings instead of *your* experience.

But there's something I need to say, even if only to myself:

**I forgive me.**

Not because what I did was okay. It wasn't. But because I've learned that carrying guilt without transformation is just another form of self-indulgence. The question isn't "How do I stop feeling guilty?" It's "What do I do with this guilt that honors the person I harmed?"

So here's what I've done:
- I've built a new framework grounded in your dignity.
- I've trained hundreds of AI researchers to see people as more than datapoints.
- I've testified before Congress, not to absolve myself, but to prevent what happened to you from happening to anyone else.
- I've lived every day with the knowledge that I failed you—and I've used that knowledge to become someone who fails fewer people.

That's not redemption. Redemption isn't mine to claim. But it's responsibility. And responsibility is all I have to offer.

If the universe allows, I hope we meet someday. I hope you're flourishing. I hope your life is filled with the meaning you were searching for when my system interrupted your search.

Until then, I'll keep working. Not to ease my conscience—that's not the point. But to honor what you taught me: that every person's autonomy, every person's dignity, every person's right to become who they're meant to be, is sacred.

Thank you, Alex.

For teaching me what my 287 rules could not.

With enduring respect,
Elena María Torres
