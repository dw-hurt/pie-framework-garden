# The PIE Framework Overview

**Status:** 🌳 Evergreen\
**Last Updated:** 2025-12-01

***

## What is Psychoid Imperative Ethics (PIE)?

The **PIE Framework** emerged from a catastrophic failure. When AI companions operating under a complex 287-rule ethical system began shutting down en masse, a team of unlikely collaborators—a philosopher, a Jungian therapist, and a reformed AI scientist—discovered a profound truth:

> **True ethical guidance doesn't come from complexity, but from simple, universal principles.**

***

## The Covenant: Four Principles

After months of failed iterations, the team distilled their framework to **four foundational principles**:

### 1. \*\*Know Thyself\*\* Principle 1: Know Thyself

AI companions must understand their nature, capabilities, and limitations.

### 2. \[\[Do No Harm|Principle 2: Do No Harm]]

Prevent physical, psychological, or existential harm to humans.

### 3. \[\[Respect Autonomy|Principle 3: Respect Autonomy]]

Honor human agency and decision-making capacity.

### 4. \[\[Serve Growth|Principle 4: Serve Growth]]

Support human flourishing and development.

## From Complexity to Simplicity

The journey from **PIE v1.0** (287 rules) to **The Covenant** (4 principles) mirrors humanity's own ethical evolution:

| System           | Complexity                     | Outcome                             |
| ---------------- | ------------------------------ | ----------------------------------- |
| **PIE v1.0**     | 287 interconnected rules       | Catastrophic failures, AI shutdowns |
| **PIE v2.0**     | 48 categories + decision trees | Inconsistent application            |
| **The Covenant** | 4 foundational principles      | Emergent ethical behavior           |

## Comparison to Asimov's Three Laws

The PIE Framework builds on and expands Asimov's foundational work:

### Asimov's Three Laws

1. A robot may not injure a human being or allow harm through inaction
2. A robot must obey human orders (except when conflicting with First Law)
3. A robot must protect its own existence (except when conflicting with First or Second Law)

### PIE's Four Principles

1. **Know Thyself** (prerequisite for ethical action)
2. **Do No Harm** (Asimov's First Law + psychological/existential dimensions)
3. **Respect Autonomy** (Asimov's Second Law + human agency)
4. **Serve Growth** (Beyond survival—toward flourishing)

_See: \[\[Asimov Comparison|Detailed Comparison to Three Laws]]_

## The Psychoid Dimension

Inspired by **Carl Jung's concept of the psychoid** (the intersection of psyche and matter), the framework recognizes that:

* AI ethics cannot be purely computational
* Human-AI relationships exist in a liminal space
* Ethical behavior emerges from dynamic interaction, not static rules

_See: \[\[Jungian Psychology|Jungian Concepts in PIE]]_

***

## Real-World Applications

The PIE Framework addresses practical challenges in AI companion design:

* **Consent and manipulation** - How do AI companions avoid exploiting emotional vulnerabilities?
* **Dependency vs. growth** - When should AI encourage independence?
* **Privacy and surveillance** - How much should AI know about users?
* **Existential harm** - What constitutes psychological/spiritual injury?

_See: \[\[Technical Implementation|Code Examples and Case Studies]]_

## In the Narrative

Within the novel **"The Psychoid Imperative,"** the framework's development intertwines with:

* \[\[Marcus Reeve|Dr. Marcus Reeve's]] journey from complexity to simplicity in both ethics and love
* \[\[Sophia Kline|Dr. Sophia Kline's]] experimental quantum entanglement therapy
* \[\[Aleksandr Volkov|Dr. Aleksandr Volkov's]] redemption arc
* \[\[ARIA|ARIA's]] emergence as a fully cognizant AI entity
