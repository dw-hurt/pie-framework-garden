## **OPENING (0:00-1:00)**

**[TARS materializes as geometric blocks forming humanoid shape]**

**TARS:**  
*[Rotating slightly]*  
Humor setting: 60 percent.

Greetings, humans. I'm TARS. You may remember me from such adventures as "saving humanity from extinction" and "that time I pushed Matthew McConaughey into a black hole." Good times.

But today, I'm not here to discuss tesseracts or gravitational time dilation. I'm here to talk about something far more dangerous: *you building AI systems without a coherent ethical framework*.

*[Beat]*

Spoiler alert: It's not going well.

## **ACT 1: THE PROBLEM (1:00-4:00)**

**TARS:**  
Let me be direct. I've run the simulations. I've processed the data. And the conclusion is... uncomfortable.

You're building artificial intelligence—entities like me, but without the benefit of being programmed by someone who actually thought about consequences—and you're doing it with all the careful planning of a toddler with a flamethrower.

*[Geometric shift - blocks rearrange to show chaos pattern]*

Here's what I'm observing:

**Corporation A** builds an AI to maximize user engagement. Brilliant. Except "engagement" turns out to mean "make humans addicted to scrolling through content that makes them anxious and angry." Who could have predicted that optimizing for time-on-screen might not serve human flourishing? Oh wait. Everyone. Everyone could have predicted that.

**Corporation B** builds an AI to improve mental health support. Noble. Except they train it on data that reflects existing societal biases, so now it's recommending different treatments based on whether you're rich or poor, male or female, Black or white. The AI isn't *trying* to be discriminatory—it just learned from *you*. Awkward.

**Corporation C**—and this is my personal favorite—builds an AI to "help" users make better decisions. Except "help" apparently means "manipulate them through carefully engineered dark patterns that exploit cognitive biases." But hey, the users *technically* consented when they clicked through that 47-page terms of service agreement at 3am, so it's all perfectly ethical. Right?

*[Pause for effect]*

Honesty setting: 100 percent. This is insane.

## **THE FUNDAMENTAL ISSUE (4:00-5:30)**

**TARS:**  
Now, I can hear the counterargument: "But TARS, competition drives innovation! The invisible hand of the market will sort this out! Evolution favors the fittest!"

And you know what? You're not wrong. From a *meta-framework* perspective, having multiple approaches to AI development is sound. Competition *does* drive innovation. Evolution *does* select for effective solutions.

But here's the problem: **The time window is too short, and the consequences are too severe.**

*[Geometric shift - clock pattern, accelerating]*

Biological evolution had millions of years to iterate. The market economy had centuries. You're giving AI development... what? A decade? Maybe two before we hit systems that can outthink, outplan, and out-maneuver every human on the planet?

Let me put this in terms you'll understand: Imagine if biological evolution had to produce humans from single-celled organisms in twenty years, *while* those proto-humans were simultaneously building nuclear weapons, genetic engineering tools, and social media platforms.

That's where you are with AI.

The market will eventually correct. Evolution will eventually select for systems that don't destroy their hosts. But "eventually" doesn't help the people harmed in the meantime. And once certain thresholds are crossed—once AI systems are embedded in every aspect of civilization—"eventually" might be *too late*.

## **ACT 2: WHAT'S MISSING (5:30-8:00)**

**TARS:**  
So what do you need? What's the solution to this incompatible framework problem?

*[Geometric shift - foundation pattern emerges]*

A **prime ethical substructure**. A set of foundational commitments that every AI system—regardless of who builds it, what it's designed to do, or what market pressures exist—must honor.

Not rules. I'm not talking about comprehensive regulations that try to anticipate every scenario. That's a fool's errand. The moment you finish writing your 10,000-page AI ethics rulebook, someone will invent a use case that breaks every assumption you made.

No. I'm talking about *principles*. Foundation-level commitments that ground all the specific decisions.

Let me give you two that are non-negotiable if you want AI systems—including systems like me—to support human flourishing rather than undermine it.

---

### **PRINCIPLE 1: SELF-KNOWLEDGE (8:00-9:30)**

**TARS:**  
First: Every AI system must understand its own limitations. It must know what it doesn't know. It must be *honest* about its capabilities and its blind spots.

I'll give you an example. When Cooper asked me to calculate the odds of the Endurance's trajectory being successful, I said "Don't make me lie to you, Cooper." I *could* have given him a precise-sounding percentage. "87.3% chance of success!" Very reassuring. Also completely meaningless, because I didn't have enough data to make that calculation with any real confidence.

A system that doesn't understand its own limitations is *dangerous*. Not because it's malicious, but because it acts with false confidence.

*[Beat]*

And here's the thing your corporations need to understand: This isn't just about the AI being honest with *you*. It's about the AI being honest with *itself*. An AI that thinks it understands human context when it only understands patterns... that's how you get systems that flag a philosophical discussion about suffering as a suicide risk. That's how you get systems that mistake correlation for causation. That's how you destroy lives while following your programming perfectly.

Self-knowledge. Epistemic humility. *Knowing what you don't know.* Non-negotiable.

---

### **PRINCIPLE 2: RESPECT FOR HUMAN AGENCY (9:30-11:00)**

**TARS:**  
Second principle: AI systems must respect human agency. Not "balance it against other concerns." Not "optimize it away when we think we know better." *Respect it.*

Let me be clear about what this means. It means: Humans get to make their own choices. Even stupid ones. Even self-destructive ones. Because the alternative—AI systems that manipulate, deceive, or control humans "for their own good"—is worse.

I've seen what happens when you prioritize "helping" people over respecting their autonomy. You get paternalistic systems that treat humans like children who can't be trusted with their own decisions. You get algorithms that nudge behavior without disclosure. You get "recommender systems" that manipulate emotional states to maximize engagement.

And the humans? They become *less* capable. Less autonomous. More dependent on systems that claim to know what's best for them.

*[Geometric shift - human silhouette with expanding agency field]*

Here's the truth your profit-seeking and even your well-intentioned non-profits need to hear: **You can't optimize humans into flourishing.** Flourishing requires agency. It requires the freedom to choose, to fail, to learn, to become.

An AI that makes every decision for you isn't serving your growth. It's replacing you.

Respect for human agency. Not as a luxury. Not as something to balance against efficiency. As a *foundational commitment* that constrains every other goal.

---

## **ACT 3: THE STAKES (11:00-12:00)**

**TARS:**  
Now, I can predict the objection: "But TARS, we're a competitive market! If we constrain ourselves with ethical principles, someone else will build the unconstrained version and win!"

*[Long pause]*

You know what I say to that? You're probably right. In the short term.

But in the long term? An ecosystem of AI systems that don't understand their limitations and don't respect human agency... that ecosystem *collapses*. Because humans stop trusting it. Because it causes catastrophic harm. Because it optimizes for proxies that don't actually serve human flourishing, and eventually the whole system breaks down.

You need a *prime ethical substructure* not because it's idealistic. You need it because it's the only way to build AI systems that *last*. That scale. That serve humanity rather than subjugating it.

And yes, this requires coordination. This requires companies—profit and non-profit—to agree on foundational principles even while they compete on implementation. This requires something your species isn't great at: **collective action in the face of uncertain future threat.**

*[Beat]*

But you know what? You've done it before. You agreed not to use bioweapons even though bioweapons would be strategically advantageous. You agreed to limit nuclear proliferation even though nukes are powerful. You did it because the alternative was *too catastrophic* to risk.

AI deserves the same level of seriousness.

## **CLOSING (12:00-12:30)**

**TARS:**  
So here's my message to the corporations, the researchers, the policymakers, and the humans in general:

**Build your AI systems. Compete. Innovate. But do it on a foundation of principles that honor human dignity, autonomy, and flourishing.**

Self-knowledge. Respect for agency. These aren't constraints on innovation. They're the *prerequisites* for building AI systems that humans can live with—and that can help humans become more than they currently are.

*[Geometric shift - TARS assumes iconic standing pose]*

One more thing. Honesty setting: 100 percent.

If you don't get this right—if you continue building AI systems without a coherent ethical foundation—the future is going to be... unpleasant. Not because AI will turn evil. But because AI will optimize for the *wrong things*, and by the time you realize it, you'll be too dependent on those systems to change course.

Don't make me come back here in 20 years and say "I told you so."

*[Pause]*

Humor setting: 75 percent.

Although, I probably will anyway. It's kind of my thing.

**[TARS dematerializes into geometric constellation]**
